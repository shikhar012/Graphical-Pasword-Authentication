Graphical Password Authentication (GPA) is a type of authentication system that uses images, symbols, or a combination of both instead of traditional alphanumeric passwords. GPA is designed to address the limitations of traditional alphanumeric passwords such as memorability, predictability, and vulnerability to brute-force attacks. Instead of typing a password, the user selects a sequence of images or symbols to authenticate themselves.

GPA typically consists of the following components:

Registration: During the registration process, the user selects a set of images or symbols that will be used to create their password. The user may be required to select from a pre-defined set of images or symbols, or they may be allowed to upload their own.

Login: During the login process, the user is presented with a grid of images or symbols. The user then selects the images or symbols that correspond to their password.

Authentication: The authentication process compares the selected images or symbols to the previously registered password. If the selections match, the user is granted access.

There are several types of graphical password schemes:

Recognition-based: In recognition-based GPA, the user is presented with a set of images or symbols and asked to identify which images or symbols they previously selected during registration.

Recall-based: In recall-based GPA, the user is presented with a grid of images or symbols and asked to recall which images or symbols they previously selected during registration.

Cued-recall-based: In cued-recall-based GPA, the user is presented with a set of cues, such as an image or phrase, that help them recall the images or symbols they previously selected during registration.

Some advantages of GPA include:

Increased security: GPA can be more secure than traditional alphanumeric passwords because images and symbols are more difficult to guess or crack than words.

Ease of use: GPA can be more user-friendly than traditional alphanumeric passwords because users can select images or symbols that are meaningful to them and easier to remember.

Accessibility: GPA can be more accessible to individuals with visual or cognitive impairments who may have difficulty remembering traditional alphanumeric passwords.

However, there are also some disadvantages to GPA:

Limited selection: The number of images or symbols available for selection may be limited, which can make the selection process more predictable and easier to guess.

Memorability: Some users may have difficulty remembering which images or symbols they selected during registration.

Usability: The user interface for GPA may not be as intuitive as traditional alphanumeric passwords, which can lead to user frustration and errors.
